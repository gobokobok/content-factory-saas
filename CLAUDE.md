# Content Factory — Session Bootstrap

## Startup protocol
On every new session, read in this order:
1. **This file** (CLAUDE.md)
2. **SPRINT.md** — current sprint status and story table (active sprints only; history in SPRINT_ARCHIVE.md)
3. **The active story** in **BACKLOG_ACTIVE.md** (current + next two sprints; full archive in BACKLOG.md)
4. **DONE.md** — recent entries for context (older ones are in DONE_ARCHIVE.md)
5. **CONVENTIONS.md** — coding standards before touching any code

## Project summary
Content Factory is a modular, automated content production pipeline for "The Housing Equation" — a faceless, data-driven YouTube Shorts channel about American housing economics. The operator triggers and monitors each pipeline step via a minimal HTML/JS web UI hosted on Railway. POC scope covers pipeline Steps 2b–7; Step 2a (`script-generator.html`) is a standalone reference tool in `/tools`, not integrated.

## Current sprint
**Platform v2 — Pipeline & Platform Update spec (D092–D101).** Next sprint: **P13 — Storyboard control** (per-scene asset strategy editable before acquisition; split and merge scenes — D095). P12 (Projects & Shortlist) is complete. Studio is the only operator interface: `/` project list → `/project?id=` shortlist + runs → `/studio#run/<id>` pipeline. Telegram is dormant (D093); legacy pipeline UI lives at `/legacy`.
_Backlog order: P13 Storyboard control → P13b CapCut export (D100) → P14 AI Created style → P15 Research → P16 Publishing via n8n → P17 Server-side Auto Advance._

## Active story
**Sprint P13 — all four stories, built in one pass** (METHODOLOGY.md, 2026-10-03): P13-S1 asset strategy, P13-S2 split / merge, P13-S3 Storyboard stage controls + confirm gate, P13-S4 script view. Order: (S1 ∥ S2) → (S3 ∥ S4). Stories: BACKLOG_ACTIVE.md, EPIC 44.

**Blockers / operator actions:** Google API audit application in progress — operator will submit (lead time for P16 publishing). 1 smoke test deferred (P10-S2 asset swap from Studio — clears in P13).

## Run folder structure (Drive)
```
/Content Factory/runs/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{slug}/
  storyboard.json
  asset_manifest.json
  run_log.json        ← step-level checkpoint state
  run_log.txt         ← human-readable log
  ffmpeg_script.sh
  /video
  /images
  /sfx
  /music              ← copied from /music-library
  /voiceover          ← operator uploads .mp3 here
  /output
```

## Drive root structure
```
/Content Factory          ← PROD root (GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_ID)
  /music-library          ← shared, operator-managed
  /runs
    /{YYYY-MM-DD}_{slug}/
```

## Hard constraints
- **No new dependencies** without a DECISIONS.md entry first
- **Every function** must have a docstring
- **Every story** ships with tests (see docs/TESTING.md)
- **No hardcoded values** — all config via ENV vars
- **No UI frameworks** — plain HTML/JS only for operator UI
- **Free-tier APIs only** for POC (Pexels, Pixabay, Freesound) — exception: paid AI image generation (D096)
- CI must be green before marking a story complete
- **Pipeline step functions must be pure async** — take explicit inputs, return explicit outputs, no coupling to HTTP request context. Routes are thin wrappers only. See CONVENTIONS.md § Async function discipline and DECISIONS.md D040.

## Human Touchpoint Rule
Every sprint must include or culminate in a human-testable artifact. If the sprint is purely infrastructure, scope a minimal UI shim or smoke-test endpoint that a non-technical stakeholder can interact with. Never go more than one sprint without something a human can touch.

**Before finalizing any sprint plan, answer:** "What can a human touch at the end of this sprint?" If the answer is nothing, add a story.

## Pipeline steps reference

| Step | Epic | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 2a   | —    | Brief → Script (`/tools/script-generator.html`, standalone) |
| 2b   | E1   | Script → `storyboard.json` (Claude API, prompt v0.4) |
| 3    | E2   | Storyboard → `asset_manifest.json` |
| 4    | E3   | Asset acquisition (Pexels → Replicate fallback) |
| 5    | E4   | Asset manifest → `ffmpeg_script.sh` |
| 6    | E5   | FFmpeg execution → upload output to Drive |
| 7    | E6   | Operator UI (trigger, monitor, retry, upload voiceover) |
