## [E1-S1] Railway service skeleton
**Completed:** 2026-05-22
**Sprint:** 1
**Handover:**
- `src/config.py`: `Settings` (pydantic-settings) — validates all 7 required ENV vars at startup. Import with `from src.config import get_settings`. Inject into routes via `Depends(get_settings)`.
- `src/main.py`: FastAPI app entry point. Lifespan hook crashes fast on bad ENV with a clear error log. `GET /health` live. Register all future routers here via `app.include_router()`.
- `tests/test_health.py`: 13 passing tests. Settings injection pattern: `app.dependency_overrides[get_settings] = lambda: settings`. ENV isolation in tests: `monkeypatch.delenv(key, raising=False)`.
- Railway DEV deployed and verified: `https://content-factory-dev-production.up.railway.app/health` → `{"status":"ok","environment":"dev"}`.
- All 8 ENV vars live in Railway Variables tab (including `LOG_LEVEL=INFO`).
- `railway.toml` (DEV) and `railway.prod.toml` (PROD) already correct — no changes needed.
**Promoted to backlog:** none
